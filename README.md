# MCHM

This repository contains the raw R scripts and supporting information to performe analysis of variant sequencing data from MCHM ILE experiments included in chapter 5 of the PhD dissertation of Michael C. Ayers entitled, "The role of genotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistance to 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol."

The R script of the vcf filtering is the file "entire_R_process_script.R".
The R packages needed to perform the analysis are listed, with the versions used during analysis, and their citations in "Supplemental Table 2.xlsx".

"Supplemantal Table 1.csv" contains a table of all 6800 variants contained in the 16 ILE strains from analysis.
"Supplemental File 1.xlsx" contains 8 tables with the coding variants, their allele change consequences, and SIFT analysis scores for the 8 MCHM evolved strains.
"Summary matrix of relevant genes across all strains.xlsx" contains a matrix that shows how many mutations each relevant MCHM evolved gene has in all 16 strains. The purpose of this matrix is to identify genes with mutations in multiple MCHM ILEs but no control ILEs.
