# MCHM

This repository contains the raw R scripts and supporting information to perform analysis of variant sequencing data from MCHM ILE experiments included in chapter 5 of the PhD dissertation of Michael C. Ayers entitled, "The role of genotype in Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistance to 4-methylcyclohexanemethanol."

The R script of the vcf filtering is the file "entire_R_process_script.R".
The R packages needed to perform the analysis are listed, with the versions used during analysis, and their citations in "Supplemental Table 1.xlsx".

"Supplemental File 1.xlsx" contains 8 tables with the coding variants, their allele change consequences, and SIFT analysis scores for the 8 MCHM evolved strains.

"Supplemental File 2.xlsx" contains a matrix that shows how many mutations each of 107 relevant MCHM evolved genes has in all 16 strains. The purpose of this matrix is to identify genes with mutations in multiple MCHM ILEs but no control ILEs.

"Supplemental Table 2.csv" contains a list of the 107 genes from MCHM evolved strains containing unique synonymous or nonsynonymous mutations used for intersection graphs and GO term analysis.

"Supplemental Table 3.xlsx" contains a list of the 75 genes from MCHM evolved strains containing unique nonsynonymous mutations only, used for intersection graphs and GO term analysis.

"Supplemantal Table 4.csv" contains a table of all 6800 variants contained in the 16 ILE strains from analysis.
